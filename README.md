# Vanguard AB Test Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Vanguard AB Test Data Analysis Project! This project aims to analyze the results of an A/B test conducted by Vanguard to evaluate the effectiveness of a redesigned digital interface.

## Introduction

In this project, we analyze data from an A/B test conducted by Vanguard to assess the impact of a redesigned digital interface on client behavior and completion rates. The experiment ran from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017, with clients randomly assigned to either the control group (traditional interface) or the test group (redesigned interface).

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Folder containing the datasets used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
- `presentation/`: Slides for the project presentation.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Data Sources

- `df_final_demo.csv`: Client demographics and account details.
- `df_final_web_data.csv`: Detailed client interactions online.
- `df_final_experiment_clients.csv`: List of clients included in the experiment.

## Project Tasks

- EDA & Data Cleaning: Explore and clean the datasets.
- Performance Metrics: Calculate completion rates and assess the redesign outcome.
- Hypothesis Testing: Conduct hypothesis tests to evaluate the effectiveness of the redesign.
- Experiment Evaluation: Assess the design effectiveness, duration, and additional data needs.
- Tableau: Create visualizations using Tableau for interactive exploration.
- Finalize Project & Presentation: Review analysis, prepare documentation, and create presentation slides.
