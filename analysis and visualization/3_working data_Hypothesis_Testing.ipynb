    "As part of your analysis, you’ll conduct hypothesis testing to make data-driven conclusions about the effectiveness of the redesign. See the full details below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Completion Rate\n",
    "Given the data and KPIs you have explored discussed, one interesting hypothesis to test is related to the completion rate between the Test and Control groups. Since the new design (Test group) had a higher completion rate compared to the old design (Control group), you are required to confirm if this difference is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to define the proper null and an alternative hypothesis to test it. Use the provided data to test these hypotheses, and determine if you can reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. Make sure to consider the significance level, p-value, the statistical test prerequisites, and other relevant statistical measures in your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completion Rate with a Cost-Effectiveness Threshold\n",
    "The introduction of a new UI design comes with its associated costs: design, development, testing, potential training for staff, and possible short-term disruptions or adjustments for users. To justify these costs, Vanguard has determined that any new design should lead to a minimum increase in the completion rate to be deemed cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threshold: Vanguard has set this minimum increase in completion rate at 5%. This is the rate at which the projected benefits, in terms of increased user engagement and potential revenue, are estimated to outweigh the costs of the new design.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to carry out another analysis, ensuring that the observed increase in completion rate from the A/B test meets or exceeds this 5% threshold. If the new design doesn’t lead to at least this level of improvement, it may not be justifiable from a cost perspective, regardless of its statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Hypothesis Examples\n",
    "You have been given the freedom to choose another hypothesis to test. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to test whether the average age of clients engaging with the new process is the same as those engaging with the old process\n",
    "You might want to test if the average client tenure (how long they’ve been with Vanguard) of those engaging with the new process is the same as those engaging with the old process\n",
    "You might want to test if there are gender differences that affect engaging with the new or old process\n",
    "Make sure to define the proper null and alternative hypothesis to test it. You are required to choose one or come up with another of your own to test.\n",

    "\n",
    "    **Experiment Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also required to carry out an evaluation of the experiment by answering questions about the design effectiveness, duration and any additional data needs. See the full details below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Design Effectiveness\n",
    "Was the experiment well-structured?\n",
    "Were clients randomly and equally divided between the old and new designs?\n",
    "Were there any biases?\n",
    "Duration Assessment\n",
    "Was the timeframe of the experiment (from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017) adequate to gather meaningful data and insights?\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Data Needs\n",
    "What other data, if available, could enhance the analysis?"
